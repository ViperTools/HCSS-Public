<p align="center">HCSS (Hydra CSS) is a modified (and hopefully improved) version of CSS that provides extra functionality and syntax shortcuts. It is not like most other CSS preprocessors. HCSS does not allow blatantly invalid syntax, and is not as forgiving in many aspects. This allows HCSS to stay readable and consistent across projects.</p>
