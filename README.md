<p align="center">HCSS (Hydra CSS) is a modified (and hopefully improved) version of CSS that provides extra functionality and syntax shortcuts. It is not like most other CSS preprocessors. HCSS does not allow blatantly invalid syntax, and is not as forgiving in many aspects. This allows HCSS to stay readable and consistent across projects.</p>

<h3>Currently the HCSS source code is private and incomplete. You can see planned features and syntax in the <a href="https://github.com/ViperTools/HCSS-Public/wiki">wiki</a>. Nothing is final, but most features should not change drastically.</h3>
